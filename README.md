# Recursive PDF OCR Layer Remover
A high-performance **C# .NET** automation utility built for bulk document security. This tool scans a source directory, identifies all PDF files, and strips their OCR (text) layers to make them **non-searchable and non-copyable**. 

The standout feature is its ability to **mirror the exact folder structure** in the output directory, making it ideal for enterprise-level document archiving.

## Key Features
* **OCR Layer Stripping:** Converts searchable text layers into flattened, high-fidelity images.
* **Recursive Folder Processing:** Automatically crawls through sub-folders to find and process PDFs.
* **Structure Mirroring:** Recreates the original source directory tree in the output folder.
* **Privacy Focused:** Prevents automated data scraping and text-indexing.
* **Bulk Processing:** Built to handle hundreds of files efficiently using .NET streams.

## Technical Stack
* **Language:** C#
* **Framework:** .NET 6.0 / .NET Core
* **Core Logic:** Image Rasterization & PDF Reconstruction

## How to Use
1. **Configure Paths:** Set your `SourcePath` (where searchable PDFs are) and `OutputPath` in the config.
2. **Run Execution:** The tool will begin mapping the folders.
3. **Verification:** Check the output folder; you will find the same sub-folder names with "Clean" image-only PDFs inside.

## Example Workflow
```text
Source/
├── Legal/
│   └── contract.pdf (Searchable)
└── Finance/
    └── invoice.pdf (Searchable)

Output/
├── Legal/
│   └── contract.pdf (Non-Searchable Image)
└── Finance/
    └── invoice.pdf (Non-Searchable Image)
